People come to the Ministry of the Interior in the morning to retrieve one or more documents.

The documents can be:
1. Identity card
2. Passport
3. Driver's license

When the counter opens, people waiting for ID cards are served first, then those for passports, and finally those for driver's licenses.

When each person arrives, they stand in the queue for the appropriate document that they need (ie either in the queue for ID cards or in the queue for passports or in the queue for driver's licenses). If a person needs several documents, first they get an ID card, then a passport and finally a driver's license. Thus, if a person needs to get both an ID card and a driver's license, he first stands in the queue for ID cards, and after he finishes there, he goes to the end of the queue for driver's licenses.

Input: The first row indicates how many people came to the Ministry of Interior in total. Then four lines are entered for each person, in the first is the name and surname of the person, and in the remaining three lines it is said which document (identity card, passport and driver's license) is needed, where 1 means that the document is needed, 0 means it is not.

For example:

Aleksandar Aleksandrovski
1
0
1

indicates that Aleksandar Aleksandrovski will get an ID card and driver's license, but will not get a passport.

Output: Prints the names of the people in the order in which they finish extracting documents.

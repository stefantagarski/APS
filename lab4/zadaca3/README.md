Given is a sequence of `N` positive integers and a number `K`. Let the numbers be denoted by `a0 to aN−1`. Let us define the sum of absolute differences as `abs(a1−a0)+abs(a2−a1)+…+abs(aN−1−aN−2)`. Choose exactly `K` numbers from the sequence so that when they are joined into a single sequence, the sum of absolute differences is maximal. Print this sum.

*Input*: In the first line the two numbers N (1≤N≤100) and K (1≤K≤100, K≤N) are given. In the second line, you N positive integers are given, each of which is less than 1,000.

*Output*: Print the requested maximum sum of absolute differences.

*Note*: The numbers are taken in the order in which they are given in the first sequence. The order of the numbers in the newly obtained sequence must not be changed.

For a given array with N words, find the word with the length closest to the average length of the words in the array.
If there are two words with lengths that are the same distance as the average length, return the longer word.
Additionally, if they are with the same length, you take the first one.
For example for the array "a", "an", "cat", "door", and "apple" the average word length is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3, which means that the word with length closest to the average length is "cat" (length is 3).

For the array "I", "on", "dog", "star", "water", and "bright" the average word length is 3.5 and both words "dog" and "star" have lengths that are equally distant to the average length (lengths are 3 and 4, respectively). The correct answer is the longer word which is "star" (with length 4).

There can be duplicates in the array.

Input: The first number in the input is the number of words in the array N, then the words follow in each line.

Output: The found word, that is with length closest to the average word length in the array.

Pay attention:
1. All the needed code for the structure that you need to use is given. The test class ArrayMeanWordLength.java is also given, with completely implemented input and output. You only need to change the code of the String wordClosestToAverageLength(Array<String> arr) method.
2. You must not change the main method!


2.//
You are given a single linked list with integer nodes. Additionally, you are given one more integer M (M>1). You need to delete every M-th element from the list.

Input: In the first line from the input the number of elements in the list is given, and then in the next line the elements themselves.
In the last line, the integer M is given.

Output: The transformed list (with every M-th element deleted) should be printed at the output.

Pay attention:
1. All the needed code for the structure that you need to use is given. 
The test class SpecialSLLDelete.java is also given, with completely implemented input and output.
You only need to change the code of the void specialDelete(SLL<Integer> list, int m) method.
2. You must not change the main method!

In a mystical card game, each card embodies a creature with a specific type (int type), a health value (int health), and a magic power value (int magicPower).
The significance of a card is determined by the product of its health and magic power values.
Two sorcerers decide to challenge each other in a duel, each with their own deck of cards.
The decks are represented as two single linked lists. In the first list, we keep the cards of the first sorcerer, and in the second list,
we keep the cards of the second sorcerer. Initially, both sorcerers have exactly 8 cards each.
At the very beginning of the duel, the rules require that the first sorcerer gives their best card to the other sorcerer,
so that the second sorcerer takes that card and has to put it in the middle of their deck of cards.
This means that we need to remove (delete) the best card from the list that keeps the cards of the first sorcerer and add that card in the middle of the list that keeps the cards of the second sorcerer.

Input: In each row of input we have the data for one card, separated with space, in the format type health magicPower.
First, we have the cards of the first sorcerer, and after that follow the cards for the second sorcerer.

Output: In the first row the type of all the cards of the first field. In the second row the type of all the cards of the second friend.

Pay attention:

1. All the needed code for the structure that you need to use is given.
The test class MysticalCardGame.java is also given, with completely implemented input and output.
You only need to change the code of the void startDuel(SLL<Card> firstSorcererCards, SLL<Card> secondSorcererCards) method.
2. You must not change the main method!

There were N adults and M children that wanted to travel from the bus station in FinTown to the neighbouring city MinTown. The price of one ticket is 100 den. If an adult wants to travel with K children, he would need to pay one ticket for him and K-1 tickets for the children (the ticket for one of the children is free). The adults can also travel by themselves, in which case they only pay one ticket. Additionally we know that the children can't travel without being accompanied by an adult.

In the first row the number N is given, and then in the second row the number M. You need to calculate the minimum and the maximum value in den. that the passengers can pay for their tickets, and print them in two separate lines. There will be at least one adult in the bus.
